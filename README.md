# Swansea University Calculator

This is a degree calculator for Swansea University based on the formula given on Freedom of Information by Swansea University (https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/259192/response/640870/attach/html/3/FOI%20Response%20151%2014%2015.pdf.html). This is specifically towards a course built up on 15 credit modules.

Obviously I can't guarantee this is what your end result will be, or even if this is the formula for your degree. Any questions to 921340@swansea.ac.uk

You can run this locally. Download the index.html (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pascalla/Swansea-University-Calculator/master/index.html > Right Click > Save As) and open in a browser and then fill in the modules. This was built around my Computer Science course which consisted of 8 modules per year.
